# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

  Your answer:
  
  - The difference between a parameter and an argument is that parameters are variables which are in a declaration of functions. The argument is when a value is called by the function.

  Researched answer:
  
  - A pparameter is a placeholder for the data that the user passes info to in a function. The argument is the data that is passed to the parameter. Parameter represents data that does not contain any data itself.



2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

  Your answer:
  
  - The .map() method goes through each value in an array, incrementally by +1 whole number until it reaches the last value. It will print all numbers. .map() takes 4 predefined parameters - index, function, value, and array. The required parameters are value and function.

  Researched answer:

  - The function has 5 defined parameters: function, value, index, value and array. The 2 required parameters are function () => {} and value.



3. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer:

  - It is when we assign keys to a variable. The keys can now fit into an array. This makes it possible to reuse the keys. 

  Researched answer:

  - Object destructuring is the practice of assigning keys in the object to their own specific variables. Destructuring makes it possible to unpack the keys into an array. It break down the values and creates a new variable and assigns them into a single assignment.
  
  - Ex.) is an example of object destructuring is a hyperlink in a word document. Or if we had a variable object car that has 2 keys color and brand, we could restructure the keys out using the syntax var Curley brace color, key Curley brace equals car. This would give me access to the values of color and brand. With this access I could reassign the color to be something different by just calling on color not by calling on car.color.




4. What is the difference between a function and a method?

  Your answer:

  - While a function is code written to run a set of tasks, a method is within a function that has a task to be called on by the function.

  Researched answer:

  - A method belongs to a class and an object. It is a function within a function. A function is a section of code thats performs a specific set of tasks. We can define a function using the function keyword, name and parameters.


5. What is the difference between a class and an object?

  Your answer:

  - A class is a container which holds information. An example of that is like a blueprint, an object is more specific. It falls within the class.

  Researched answer:

  - An object is a container for the information. It contains methods and data. A class is a set of blueprints and instructions the object needs to follow upon instantiation. The behavior of the information inside the object is dictated by the class. 



6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

  Your answer:

  Researched answer:
  
  - Before the execution of the code interpreter moves the functions, variables, and classes to the top of the script’s scope which allows the invocation of the function before it’s even defined.  Can also use classes before they are defined. Variables only get declared but not initialize. You can reassign a variable but not use the initial value before it’s defined.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Class Inheritance: Class inheritance: Method of re-using functions from a parent class in a child class.

2. React: React is a library of reusable and commonly used components.

3. React state: Object used by REACT to represent information about the components current situation.

4. React lifecycle methods: Each component in REACT has a lifecycle with 3 phases that can be monitored. 3 phases are mounting, updating, and un-mounting. Ex. Methods render(), componentDidMount(), componentDidUpdate(), componentWillUnmount().

5. DOM: DOM - Document Object Model is an interface for web documents. It represents the page so other programs can interact, change, and style the content.
